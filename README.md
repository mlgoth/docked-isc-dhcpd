==========================

This is a Dockerfile and a shell-script to run an ISC DHCP-server in a Docker
container. Thanks to being based on Alpine Linux, the storage required is less
than 25MB for the container image, whereas the running container requires just
about 3MB of ram.


Configuration file
------------------
The DHCP server configuration file is `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` on both the host and
in the container. It can be edited from either - restart the container to
reload configuration:

```
   $ docker exec -it dhcpd vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
   $ docker restart dhcpd
```

Editing the configuration from the host:

```
   host$ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf && docker restart dhcpd
```

/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf must exist before starting the container. A sample one is
provided - copy it to /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf and edit to suit your setup. Editing
the first subnat range declaration in the example file to match your local
network will be sufficient to get your own DHCP-server up and running.


Starting the container
----------------------
Run the startup script as an ordinary user, who is a member of the docker
group:
```
   $ ./run-dhcpd-container.sh
```
The script will create ~/.dhcpd-data/ on first run. View the container output:
```
   $ docker logs -f dhcpd
```
You should see log messages from dhcpd on the terminal and soon it'll be ready
to receive DHCP requests from the network.

Proceed to Testing it below or press ctrl-C to exit to the shell.


Testing and debugging
---------------------
Turn off wifi on your phone, then turn it on again. Container output will be
similar to this as the phone requests a new IP-address:
```
   DHCPREQUEST for 192.168.1.96 from 4c:d1:a1:fc:94:e5 via eth0
   DHCPACK on 192.168.1.96 to 4c:d1:a1:fc:94:e5 via eth0
```
For more testing, run nmap from a Linux host on the same LAN:
```
   $ sudo nmap --script broadcast-dhcp-discover
```
Container log output from the nmap probe will look like:
```
   DHCPDISCOVER from de:ad:c0:de:ca:fe via eth0
   DHCPOFFER on 192.168.1.200 to de:ad:c0:de:ca:fe via eth0
```

Starting after reboot
---------------------
Add the container run script to the users crontab on the host:
```
   $ crontab -e            # add the below line in your crontab editor

   @reboot docked-isc-dhcpd/run-dhcpd-container.sh
```

Logfile
-------
Output from dhcpd is logged to /var/lib/dhcp/logfile in the container and
is rotated to .old on every container restart.

The logfile can also be followed from the host with less(1):
```
   host$ less +F ~/.dhcpd-data/logfile
```

Example dhcpd/container startup output
--------------------------------------
```
   # dhcpd -f -d
